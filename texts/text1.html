                        <p class="textdkj">We have all failed in the past, and made mistakes. When we think about it, it's sad to see how we were able to make mistakes like the ones we did. Failures can be discouraging and demotivating. But should we continue to look at our past mistakes and live with them? Life would be boring if we kept remembering our failures and living by letting those same mistakes define us. It's time to start looking ahead, don't you think?
                            <br><br><b>2 Corinthians 4:16-18:</b><br>
                            <i>“Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day. For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.”</i>
                            <br><br>As these verses tell us, let us not lose heart. We may be distressed by past mistakes and failures, but we shouldn’t let those failures define who we are. Let us look forward and persevere despite these failures that we have experienced. The Lord will always be with us during the days that we will have by His grace. These failures are nothing compared to eternal glory.
                            <br><br>Failures do not mean the end, far from it. With these failures, we can learn to do better the next time, to know the things to avoid. Because for success to happen, you will have to go through a long road and even failures. But don't get discouraged, keep hoping. Let us fix our eyes on the Lord in all our activities.
                            <br><br>God bless you</p>
